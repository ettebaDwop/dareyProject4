# A simple Book Register web form using MEAN stack.

MEAN Stack is a combination of following components:
- MongoDB (Document database) – Stores and allows to retrieve data.
- Express (Back-end application framework) – Makes requests to Database for Reads and Writes.
- Angular (Front-end application framework) – Handles Client and Server Requests
- Node.js (JavaScript runtime environment) – Accepts requests and displays results to end user

The steps involved here are as follows:
1. Install NodeJs
2. Install MongoDB
3. Install Express and set up routes to the server
4. Access the routes with AngularJS


#### Step 1 Install NodeJs

#### Step 2 Install MongoDB
